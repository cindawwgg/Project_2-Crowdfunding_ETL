Group 3 (Daniel Cabera and Cindy Duong). We built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, Python dictionary methods, and regular expressions to extract and transform the data.
There are four CSV files that we loaded into table schema and created an ERD on. 
Daniel completed part 1 and Cindy completed part 2. Part 3 was completed collaboratively and both options were completed.
